# Gather Baseline Observations

Just like before, we want to define the baseline operations of our application. Since we've already done this in step 2.2, we can continue with our experiment. As a reminder, this is how the application performs under normal operating conditions. This includes validating the user experience, collecting metrics, and creating dashboards that accurately track the user experience.

Things you can do to gather observations include:

+ Registering and logging into the Sock Shop using the credentials `user`/`password`.
+ Browsing products by clicking on them.
+ Adding and removing items from the cart.
+ Checking out and completing purchases.

While performing these tasks, make sure to note:

- How long it takes to complete each task.
- How responsive the website is.
- Whether you see any error messages.
