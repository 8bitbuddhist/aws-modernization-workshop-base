# Perform the Experiment

Now that we've defined our experiment and gathered observations, let's run the experiment. Start by opening the [Gremlin](https://app.gremlin.com) tab in your browser. On the left navigation bar, click **Attacks**, followed by **New Attack.**

Under **"What do you want to attack?"**, select **Infrastructure**, then **Hosts**. You can either select each host individually, or click **Target all hosts** to select all three of your hosts.

Expand **Choose a Gremlin** and select **Resource**, then **CPU**. Change **Length** to `360`, change **CPU Capacity** to `80` and select **"All Cores"** from the dropdown.
