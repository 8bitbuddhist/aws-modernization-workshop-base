# Experiment #1: Validate Autoscaling

For this first experiment, we want to validate that our systems can scale in response to increased demand. The amount of customer traffic e-commerce shops need to accomodate can vary significantly on a day-to-day basis, especially during peak traffic periods like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As an SRE, we want to make sure our infrastructure is scalable and our monitors and dashboards properly configured. We'll use Gremlin to test this.  Let's get started!
