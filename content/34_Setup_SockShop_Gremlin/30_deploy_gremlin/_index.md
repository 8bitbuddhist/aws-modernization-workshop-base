# Deploy Gremlin

![image](/images/gremlin_mascot.png)

We'll be using Gremlin to run chaos experiments. The next steps will involve creating a new Gremlin account and deploying the Gremlin agent to our EKS cluster.

If you'd like to learn more about Gremlin, you can read [the introduction](/010_introduction/14_gremlin.html) and don't forget to read up on how to do [Chaos Engineering](010_introduction/12_problem_to_solve.html).
