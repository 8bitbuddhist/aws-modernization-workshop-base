# AWS modernization with Gremlin

In this workshop, you will get a hands-on introduction to Gremlin and the practice of Chaos Engineering. You'll take the role of a new Site Reliability Engineer working for Sock Shop, an e-commerce retailer that sells unique and boutique socks. As Sock Shop's sole SRE, you'll be responsible for keeping the site available and responsive during the company's busiest two shopping days of the year.

On day one, you'll start by setting up the infrastructure for the online store. This means deploying the container-based microservice architecture that the store runs on. You'll then be tasked with creating dashboards and alerts to track the health of the system as the first orders start rolling in.

Next, you'll have the opportunity to run Chaos Engineering experiments on your environment to ensure that what you set up is working as expected. Youâ€™ll also learn how to get ahead of potential issues before the store opens again for day two.

By the end of this workshop, not only will you have a clear understanding of how the Sock Shop works, but also the various ways that it (and other microservice-based applications) can potentially fail. You'll also know how to proactively identify and address these failure modes in order to maintain availability, prevent revenue loss, and provide the best possible experience for your customers.
